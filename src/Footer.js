        The “terms of use” are a bit different from privacy. They explain what
        the visitor agrees to by visiting the website. Like a disclaimer, they
        state that by using the site, the visitor agrees to certain things. For
        websites in highly regulated industries, Here’s where your footer can
        rescue falling visitors. If they’ve made it down this far, they must not
        have found what they were looking for. Time to offer some more options.
        The last few years have seen a usability trend called the “fat footer,”
        which means adding more than just the standard items listed above,
        starting with navigation. Footers now often contain the same links you’d
        find in a “mega-menu” dropdown in the header navigation. But this
        doesn’t necessarily save a visitor falling down your page. Remember,
        these are visitors who didn’t find what they were looking for above.
        Here are a few sources of ideas for footer navigation: Check your “Site
        Search  Queries” report in Analytics. What are visitors searching for?
        What aren’t they finding? See the Report of Broken Dreams. Check your
        “Behavior Flow” report in Analytics. Where do visitors seem to want to
        go? Here’s how to find the top path through your website. Which interior
        pages need a search ranking boost? Learn to use internal linking for an
        SEO advantage. You don’t have to just repeat your main navigation. You
        also shouldn’t just add your entire sitemap. This forces visitors to dig
        through a pile of links. How’s that helpful? you may want to put the
        text right in the footer.If legal text is critical,Place information is
        something that visitors expect to find in footers. It’s also a way to
        tell Google where you are, which is important for businesses with local
        customers. Linking to the map is a handy way to help visitors find you.
        adding it to your footer will make sure that you have maximum coverage.
        You’ve got the fine print on every page.
